- 👋 Hi, I’m Yaswanth Raja Akaveeti, an experienced Computer Architect. "yakaveet" is my git username. I am planning to work on a number of projects that simplify and enhance image content creation in software applications. I strongly believe this will have a major impact in the life's of humans on earth considering the powerful applications it can have. By impacting the life, it can have a major impact in employment creation, revenue generation and a new perspective of human lifestyle that a human can only imagine once he starts using it and gets into the world of a truly breathtaking image content processing.
- 
- 👀 I’m interested in making these projects as open-source projects that provide a framework to in turn create multiple other frameworks for image content creation and other applications in human life. However at the same time, I am also cautious in block the license for abusing this technology and using it for malign human existense in the society. This technology which I believe and it is still copyrighted as I am the sole contributor to it at this point of time. I believe that the decision on copywrights will be taken by me in the future even though I colloborate and lead a team towards the execution and further development of the project.
- 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to make this image content creation framework to be available as a python library that can be imported an integrated in python. However in the future, I plan to expand it out of python and make a programming language out of itself considering the non-compatibity of python interpreter and its framework.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on this project with people and teams who are equally compassionate, passionate in making this world a better place to live.
